# 0x00. Fix my code

- Fix my code is a new type of project, where we’ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

- Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.

- Please download the repository 0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge and use it as initial files for all solutions.

- You should not recode everything, just fix it!

- This project is NOT mandatory at all. It is 100% optional. Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won’t get hurt if you don’t do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!

- Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors in a computer program. When a program contains errors, or bugs, it may not function as expected, or it may not run at all. Debugging involves finding and correcting these errors to make the program work correctly.

- There are various techniques and tools that can be used for debugging, depending on the type and complexity of the error. Some common techniques include:

- Print debugging: This involves adding print statements to the code to display the values of variables or the flow of control at different points in the program. This can help to identify where the error is occurring and what the cause of the error may be.

- Step-by-step execution: This involves using a debugger, which is a program that allows you to execute the code line by line and monitor the values of variables and the flow of control. This can help to identify the exact point at which the error is occurring and the specific cause of the error.

- Testing: This involves running the program with different inputs and checking the output to ensure that it is correct. This can help to identify any errors that may not be immediately obvious, and to verify that the program is functioning correctly.

- Debugging can be a time-consuming and challenging process, but it is an essential part of developing high-quality software. By identifying and correcting errors in the code, you can make the program work correctly and improve the user experience.
